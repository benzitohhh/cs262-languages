# Implementing RE
# Challenge Problem 
#
# Focus: All Units
#
#
# In this problem you will write a lexer, parser and interpreter for
# strings representing regular expressions. Your program will output 
# a non-deterministic finite state machine that accepts the same language
# as that regular expression. 
#
# For example, on input 
#
# ab*c
#
# Your program might output
# 
# edges = { (1,'a')  : [ 2 ] ,
#           (2,None) : [ 3 ] ,    # epsilon transition
#           (2,'b')  : [ 2 ] ,
#           (3,'c')  : [ 4 ] } 
# accepting = [4]
# start = 1
#
# We will consider the following regular expressions:
#
#       single characters       #       a       
#       regexp1 regexp2         #       ab
#       regexp *                #       a*
#       regexp1 | regexp2       #       a|b
#       ( regexp )              #       (a|b)* -- same as (?:a|b) 
#
# That's it. We won't consider [a-c] because it's just a|b|c, and we won't
# consider a+ because it's just aa*. We will not worry about escape
# sequences. Single character can be a-z, A-Z or 0-9 -- that's it. No need
# to worry about strange character encodings. We'll use ( ) for regular
# expression grouping instead of (?: ) just to make the problem simpler.
#
# Don't worry about precedence or associativity. We'll fully parenthesize
# all regular expressions before giving them to you. 
#
# You will write a procedure re_to_nfsm(re_string). It takes as input a
# single argument -- a string representing a regular expression. It returns
# a tuple (edges,accepting,start) corresponding to an NSFM that accepts the
# same language as that regular expression.
#
# Hint: Make a lexer and a paser and an interpreter. Your interpreter may
# find it handy to know the current state and the goal state. Make up as
# many new states as you need.
